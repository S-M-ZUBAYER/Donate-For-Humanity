            <h1>Donate Today</h1>
            <P>With citizens giving so much of their own money to charities, it's imperative to know how to donate
                responsibly. Conducting careful research before sending money to an organization helps you make sure
                your
                contribution is used for good ends, and it helps keep charities and nonprofits accountable, too.</P>
